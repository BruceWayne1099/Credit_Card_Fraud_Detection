# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

A rising issue, credit card theft costs financial institutions and customers billions of dollars annually. We created a fraud detection system that employs machine learning algorithms to spot possibly fraudulent transactions in real-time in order to solve this issue. Our method is built to increase the identification of true fraud while minimizing the number of false positives (legal transactions marked as fraudulent). We used a publicly accessible dataset of credit card transactions, which includes both valid and fraudulent transactions, to train the algorithm. For the purpose of locating the top-performing machine learning models, we carried out exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training. To improve performance, we also tested several various model architectures and hyperparameters.

Our findings demonstrate that our fraud detection technology has a low false positive rate and can accurately identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. Our technology is also adaptive to shifting fraud tendencies and continues to function well over time thanks to ongoing oversight and input from analysts and investigators. Our proposed solution involves utilizing various machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Neural Nets, and Support Vector Machines to model and classify the given dataset. By training a well-generalized model, we can achieve reasonable accuracy in website classification. Additionally, we will incorporate dimension reduction methods such as Recursive feature elimination, and other methods such as correlation matrix, and cardinality of categorical variables to simplify the dataset. To determine the models' accuracy and robustness, we will employ evaluation metrics like Lift Chart, ROC curve, Precision, Recall, and F-1 score during testing.

Due to the fact that it offers a dependable and efficient method for identifying and combating credit card fraud, our project has significant consequences for financial institutions and cardholders.
